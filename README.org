#+TITLE: twitter-journal

A blank slate where the only available action is tweeting. To avoid getting distracted and overrunning iOS Screen Time limits when just trying to pop out a quick thought.

* Features
- just an iOS app for now
- uses ~twitter.nim~ library as a native code blob
  - /with header files from nim's transpilation to C/
